# Flash-Next on vLLM -- journal

Append-only, newest at the bottom. One entry per milestone/experiment:
CONFIG -> COMMAND -> RESULT -> VERDICT. ASCII only. Agents append their own
entries (header: `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM <agent> -- <title>`); the orchestrator
commits and pushes at milestones.

## 2026-10-19 22:10 orchestrator -- campaign start
CONFIG: goal = migrate Flash-Next serving from Strata (DD night-final-v3:
C1 ~141, C2 ~92/stream, prefill ~2200, 2x200K, RAM parking) to newest vLLM;
plugins first, thin rebase-clean fork second. Work done by grok-4.7 headless
agents (vllm/flashnext/grok-agent.sh), orchestrated by Claude Opus 5.5.
COMMAND: phase 1 research agents 01-06 (prompts/).
RESULT: reports/01-06. vLLM main 5fd62688 (v0.32.0 latest release) builds as
XPU wheel 0.32.1rc1.dev94 (venv /mnt/vm_8tb/b70/build/vllm-flashnext/venv).
Flash-Next = qwen4_exp; no XPU model on main (open PR #61607, eager-only
W4A16). XPU MoE on main: int4 / MXFP4 / fp8 only; no GGUF on XPU; no int2/int3
MoE. Size: IQ3_XXS 43.8 GiB fits 2x32 GiB with 2x200K KV (PLE 26.8 GiB in host
RAM); uniform int4 60.4 GiB does not. IQ3_XXS uses Q2_0 (ggml 42) on 30/48
expert downs -- no kernel anywhere in vLLM. Published sub-4-bit: Haberstroh
int2-mixed 36.1 GiB (not loadable as-is). RTN int3 pilot trails ISTA IQ4_NL
on layer-0 down (0.216 vs 0.129 rel err).
VERDICT: Track A (primary) = IQ3_XXS GGUF on vLLM-XPU with our own kernels
(port Strata KREG MMVQ / ISA IQ / XMX prefill as plugin ops). Track B
(fallback/testbed) = AutoRound ~3-bit Qwen3.6-35B-A3B + our own int3/int2
XPU MoE kernels. Dev on 35B-A3B first; latency is the metric.

## 2026-10-20 00:30 orchestrator -- wave 2 launched
CONFIG: hotschmoe-dd STOPPED (systemctl --user stop hotschmoe-dd) to free both
GPUs. Agents A1 fork/model port, A2 GGUF kernels (card 0), A3 runtime/harness/
downloads (card 1), B1 3-bit quant, B2 int3/int2 kernels (card 0).
COMMAND: prompts/A1..B2.
RESULT: pending.
VERDICT: pending.
