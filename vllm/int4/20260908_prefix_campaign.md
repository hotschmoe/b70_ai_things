# INT4 GPU prefix caching qualification

### 2026-09-08 - GPU prefix caching is required for the INT4 daily driver

CONFIG -> User explicitly requests enabling conversational prefix reuse.
Start with exact qualified R276 image/INT4 weights/MTP4/FP16 KV/200K/c4.
Only configuration delta: --no-enable-prefix-caching becomes
--enable-prefix-caching. Environment, native stack and CPU tier0 unchanged.
COMMAND -> run_prefix_campaign.py, raw root
/mnt/vm_8tb/b70/results/int4_prefix_20260908/stock-mtp4. The idle serving
instance stopped cleanly through its owned lease and post-health. Candidate
starts only after prior exit.rc0. Register descriptive experiment IDs.
RESULT -> Candidate starting; no prefix qualification claim yet. Planned:
C4 answers, repeated guides,150K A/A/B/C/D/A/A (four distinct histories
exceed451K prior pool), four88K growing tool histories, cancellation,xhigh,
four110K+8K growth pressure, postpressure answers, four132K tool histories,
all164 coding problems after stress, final canaries and199K recall.
Inspect actual pool/admission/preemptions; do not infer eviction from request
count. Require matching recall, warm cached tokens >=90% of prompt and
warm TTFT <=25% of its cold request. Inspect growing tool-history hits,
all raw corruption/new coding failures and clean lifecycle health. Existing
cache-off INT4 controls are the paired correctness reference. No new profile
unless a changed native/runtime path justifies one; the matched R276 daily
collective profile is already qualified.
VERDICT -> Prefix-off serving is not the requested conversational outcome.
Promote GPU prefix caching only after measured reuse and correctness; if
stock MTP4 fails, diagnose the concrete failure and test a bounded fix or
MTP control. RAM offload and FP8 KV remain outside this campaign. Update
startup qualification and restore hotschmoe-dd, commit/push at milestones.
